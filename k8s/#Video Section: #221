#Video Section: #221

We are saying that KB we need 1 gb of storage that's what the PVC is doing. Kubernetes will req our system to get a slice from 
the hard drive. That's going to be the persistent volume  & that persisyent volume gets handed back to our pod.

cmd: kubectl get storageclass

The above cmd shows the possible options on our computer that kubernetes have for creating the
the persistent volume.

We have only single option called "standard" & it's the default option. So if we do not specify the storage class
with our persistent volume claim the std opt will be used by default.

How the "KB" is going to decide "how to create this PV" is by using the "minikube host path" option.

"KB host path" means that when we ask KB to create this persistent volume, it will look on the host machine
and will make the little space on our personal hard drive.

On production Case:
 If we are hoisting an application on Google Cloud, the GC service called persistent disk is going to use to store inf 
 with our PV.

 Summarize:

 When we ask KB for small amount of storage on our local machine it just gonna take the slice of oue HD.

# Designating a PVC in a POD Template.

We will update the template section &  so that when the pod gets created it needs to requst some type of long term storage.
Config Explained:
  volumes > name of the postgres storage  // To get the access to the  storage.
  prsistentVolumeClaim > name of the claim that we mentioned in "db-per-vol-claim.yaml" file.
  The property "claimName" will gonna tell the KB to go to the local harddrive (local env).

  Now I need to configure to the container part that how to use that allocated space
